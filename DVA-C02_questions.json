This way, users can select the instance type they want to use when launching the CloudFormation stack, but only from the approved list.\n\nOption A is not a scalable solution as it requires creating a separate CloudFormation template for each EC2 instance type, which can become cumbersome and difficult to manage as the number of approved instance types grows.\n\nOption B is not necessary as creating resources for each EC2 instance type in the list would not enforce the requirement to choose only from the approved list. It would also increase the complexity of the template and make it difficult to manage.\n\nOption C is not ideal as it would require creating a separate parameter for each EC2 instance type, which can become difficult to manage as the number of approved instance types grows.

I paste some of words here.\n\nThe most likely cause of a failed read or a failed write is throttling. For BatchGetItem, one or more of the tables in the batch request does not have enough provisioned read capacity to support the operation. For BatchWriteItem, one or more of the tables does not have enough provisioned write capacity.\n\nIf DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation on those items. However, we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff algorithm. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.\n\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.Errors.html",

        "comment": "Exponential backoff with randomized delay is a common technique used to handle transient failures and throttle errors in distributed systems like DynamoDB. This approach involves retrying the failed operation after waiting for an increasing amount of time, which helps reduce the load on the service and increases the likelihood of success during periods of high demand or throttling.\n\nIf the BatchGetItem operation frequently returns values in the UnprocessedKeys element, it indicates that the table's read capacity might be insufficient to handle the requested workload. By increasing the provisioned read capacity for the DynamoDB tables, the application can better handle the read throughput requirements and reduce the likelihood of encountering UnprocessedKeys in batch responses.\n\nAWS SDK might provide additional features and simplifications for making requests, it does not directly address the issue of UnprocessedKeys in batch responses. This option might be beneficial for improving code maintainability and leveraging SDK features however.",

According to local regulations, PII is available to only certain people in the company and must not be shared with third parties. The company needs to make the records available to third-party organizations for statistical analysis without sharing the PII.\nA developer wants to store the original immutable record in Amazon S3. Depending on who accesses the S3 document, the document should be returned as is or with all the PII removed. The developer has written an AWS Lambda function to remove the PII from the document. The function is named removePii.\nWhat should the developer do so that the company can meet the PII requirements while maintaining only one copy of the document?",

Configure a CloudWatch alarm to notify the existing SNS topic when the error rate exceeds the specified rate is the best solution to meet the requirements.\n\nWith CloudWatch custom metrics, developers can publish and monitor custom data points, including the number of failed requests to the external payment processing API. A CloudWatch alarm can be configured to notify an SNS topic when the error rate exceeds the specified rate, allowing the support team to be notified in near real-time.\n\nOption A is not optimal since it involves scheduling a Lambda function to check the CloudWatch logs. Option C may not provide the desired functionality since it does not specify a rate at which to notify the support team. Option D is more complex than necessary, as it involves writing the results to S3 and configuring an Athena query to send notifications to an SNS topic.",

Defining a development stage on the existing API Gateway API could potentially affect customers if not managed properly. It might introduce changes or issues to the existing API that customers are using.\n\nC. Implementing a query parameter in the API application code to determine the code version introduces complexity and potential risk, as it requires changes to the application code itself.

By specifying only the production S3 bucket in the resource policy of the production Lambda function, you ensure that only events from the designated production S3 bucket can trigger the production Lambda function. This prevents development or other non-production buckets from inadvertently invoking production Lambda functions, thus maintaining environment integrity and security best practices.",

This provides fine-grained control over which IAM entities can access the functions.\n\nOption A uses the AWS_IAM auth type and creates a policy for the QA IAM group, which is a good direction.

In this case, the application consists of AWS Lambda functions behind Amazon API Gateway APIs. With the in-place deployment configuration, all traffic is shifted to the updated versions of the Lambda functions immediately after deployment.\n\nOption B suggests a linear deployment configuration that shifts 10% of the traffic every minute. While this provides controlled deployment and gradual rollout, it might not be the fastest approach if you want to minimize deployment time.\n\nOption C suggests an all-at-once deployment configuration. While this configuration might be fast, it poses a higher risk of exposing potential errors to end users all at once.",

Here's how it works:\n\nStop Pull from Main: By stopping the pull from the main branch to the feature branch, the developer can prevent the introduction of new conflicts while they are resolving the existing ones.\n\nRebase the Feature Branch: After stopping the pull, the developer can rebase the feature branch onto the main branch. This essentially replays the feature branch's changes on top of the main branch's latest changes. This allows the developer to resolve conflicts one commit at a time, addressing any conflicts that arise from the difference between the feature branch and the main branch.",

Rebase the feature branch from the main branch: Rebasing the feature branch from the main branch is an effective way to resolve merge conflicts. This approach involves updating the feature branch with the latest changes from the main branch and then applying the feature branch's changes on top of it. Rebasing can simplify the process of resolving conflicts and is generally less effort-intensive compared to creating new branches and transferring changes.\n\nC. Use the Commit Visualizer view to compare the commits when a feature was added. Fix the merge conflicts: Using tools like Commit Visualizer to understand the changes and conflicts can be helpful. However, this step alone doesn’t resolve the conflicts. The developer still needs to manually resolve the conflicts in the code.",

AWS Step Functions can orchestrate the Lambda function invocations and manage the workflow, including handling API call rate limits. The Wait state can be used to introduce delays between API calls to ensure compliance with the rate limits. This approach also allows for handling errors and retries effectively.\n\nB. Use an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to hold the API calls. Configure the Lambda function to poll the queue within the API threshold limits: While using SQS to queue API call requests is a good way to manage workload, it adds complexity to the solution.

By adding an X-Amz-Target header with a static value of 'Async' in the integration request, the API Gateway will immediately return a response to the UI, allowing it to display a message while the backend processing continues asynchronously. This ensures that the UI team does not encounter timeout errors due to long-running processes.",

This header is typically used when you want to invoke a Lambda function asynchronously, but it doesn't ensure that you get an immediate response. It essentially sends the request to a queue for asynchronous execution and doesn't wait for the processing to complete before providing a response.\n\nIn contrast, option D suggests using the X-Amz-Target header with a static value of 'Async,' which is a more appropriate choice when you need to provide an immediate response to the client while offloading the processing for background execution. This approach better aligns with the requirement of displaying a message to the user while the files are being processed, which is typically achieved through asynchronous processing with notification upon completion.",

Exponential backoff is a standard error-retry strategy where the time between retries gradually increases.

Modify the application to use the AWS SDKs for DynamoDB: The AWS SDKs implement best practices, including automatic retry logic with exponential backoff. Using an AWS SDK for DynamoDB can simplify the implementation and is more efficient than directly calling the DynamoDB REST API. This change can help mitigate throughput exceedance errors.",

Enable gradual deployments through AWS SAM templates: Gradual deployments allow you to safely deploy your application while exposing new versions to only a portion of your traffic. This approach is ideal for testing new updates in a production environment without impacting all users. AWS SAM supports the configuration of deployment preferences directly within the SAM template.\n\nD. Set the deployment preference type to Canary10Percent30Minutes. Use hooks to test the deployment: The Canary deployment type is suitable for gradually introducing a new version of the Lambda function. In this case, \"Canary10Percent30Minutes\" means that 10% of the traffic will be directed to the new version for 30 minutes. If no issues are detected, the rest of the traffic is shifted to the new version. The use of hooks allows for automated tests to run against the new deployment, ensuring its stability before full traffic shift.",

The environment parameter within the task definition allows you to specify environment variables for your containers. This approach provides a clear separation of concerns, allowing you to define the environment variables at the task definition level, which is then used by the service when running tasks.\nOption A is incorrect because the environment variables are typically defined in the task definition rather than the service definition.\n\nOptions C and D are incorrect because the entryPoint parameter is used for specifying the entry point (command) for the container, not for defining environment variables.",

The use of TOML format might be more suited for certain scenarios, but in the context of AWS SAM, which commonly relies on YAML or JSON configurations, it might be an extra layer of complexity that isn't necessary.\n\nOption C, on the other hand, recommends using a single AWS SAM configuration file with default parameters and updating testing and staging environments using the --parameter-overrides flag. This approach is more aligned with typical AWS SAM practices and is simpler and more straightforward than managing multiple configuration files.",

This infrastructure as code approach enables you to create and manage AWS resources efficiently, consistently, and repeatably. It's ideal for deploying multiple identical copies of the same infrastructure (like staging, production environments), and the text file can be version-controlled, allowing you to stage changes and revert to previous versions.\n\nAWS CodeCommit: This is a managed source control service that hosts private Git repositories.

Exponential backoff is a standard error-handling strategy for network applications in which the client progressively increases the wait time between retries, up to a maximum number of retries, when a request fails due to server-side throttling. This approach helps to smooth out the rate of API calls, reducing the likelihood of hitting the rate limit.",

This is critical for maintaining the order of ticket requests.\n\nSQS FIFO Queues: By having two separate FIFO queues for inventory management and payment processing, the application can process these aspects in parallel while still maintaining the order integrity. The FIFO nature of the queues ensures that if a seat is sold more than once, the first order received is processed first.\n\nOrder Processing Logic: With this setup, if the first order is rejected during payment processing, the second order can be processed next. The sequential processing inherent in FIFO queues ensures that this logic can be correctly implemented.",

Increasing the provisioned read capacity units (RCUs) and/or write capacity units (WCUs) for the DynamoDB table will allow it to handle a higher request rate, thereby reducing the likelihood of encountering this error. However, this approach requires careful capacity planning and may increase costs.\n\nC. Exponential backoff is a standard error retry strategy that involves progressively increasing the delay between retries when there is a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException. This approach helps to smooth out the rate of requests, giving the table time to accommodate bursts of read or write requests. Implementing exponential backoff in the application will help to effectively manage request retries and reduce the chance of continually hitting the provisioned throughput limit.",

Each function can be responsible for a specific part of the application's logic. This approach not only helps with deployment but also aligns with microservices best practices, potentially improving the maintainability and scalability of the application.\nE. Move common libraries, function dependencies, and custom runtimes into Lambda layers.\n\nLambda layers are a way to manage and share common components across multiple Lambda functions. By moving libraries, dependencies, and runtimes into layers, you reduce the size of the Lambda function's deployment package. Layers can be shared across multiple functions, leading to more efficient use of storage and easier management of common code.",

Increase the function’s reserved concurrency.\nReserved concurrency is a feature in AWS Lambda that allows you to allocate a specific amount of concurrency to a particular function. This ensures that the function has a dedicated amount of concurrency and is not affected by throttling due to high usage of other functions in your account. Increasing the reserved concurrency can help mitigate throttling issues, especially if the throttling is due to reaching account-level concurrency limits.\n\nE. Request a service quota change for increased concurrency.\nAWS Lambda has default service quotas (formerly known as limits) for the maximum number of concurrent executions across all functions in your account. If your Lambda function is experiencing throttling due to reaching these account-level concurrency limits, requesting an increase in the service quota for Lambda concurrency can provide a solution.",

This is due to Lambda concurrency mixed with VisibilityTimeout of the SQS queue.\n\nVisibilityTimeout defaults to 30 seconds. Using this default, if the Lambda takes longer than 30 seconds to process the message, then the message will become available again in the Queue for consumers. This means a second Lambda can come along and dequeue the same message - leading to duplicate processing. \n\nThis problem can be solved with A or C\n\nHowever - the question is asking for MOST cost effective\n\nThe answer MUST be C then: using Lambda Reserved Concurrency (totally free).",

The EC2 instances will have temporary security credentials provided by the role, and the permissions granted to the role can be tightly controlled using IAM policies. This approach eliminates the need to manage and store long-term access keys on the EC2 instances, which can be a security risk.\n\nC. Using the S3 GeneratePresignedUrl API call allows the application to generate time-limited URLs that provide temporary access to objects in the S3 bucket. These pre-signed URLs can be generated for authenticated users, ensuring that only authorized users can access the objects. This approach ensures that the objects in the S3 bucket remain private and are not publicly accessible.",

Mount the EFS file system in all the Lambda functions.\n\nThis approach allows Lambda functions to access large libraries or datasets that exceed the size limits of Lambda's deployment package. By using Amazon EFS, a fully managed elastic file storage, the library can be stored once and mounted onto multiple Lambda functions simultaneously. This eliminates the need to package the library with each Lambda function, which would not be feasible given the size constraints of Lambda layers and deployment packages. Additionally, this method requires minimal code changes, focusing only on configuring the Lambda functions to mount the EFS file system, providing a scalable and efficient solution for making large libraries available to serverless applications.",

Use Lambda layers to package and load dependencies.\n\nLambda layers are a way to manage your function's dependencies separately, reducing the size of the deployment package that needs to be uploaded when the function's code changes. By moving the large module or other dependencies to a Lambda layer, only changes to the function's own code need to be uploaded during deployment, which can significantly speed up the deployment process. This approach allows for more efficient management of libraries and dependencies, making deployments quicker and more streamlined without altering the function's memory size, which would not directly impact deployment speed, or relying on external services like Amazon S3 or AWS CodeDeploy in a way that doesn't specifically address deployment speed for large dependencies.",

Amazon ElastiCache for Redis can act as a high-performance, in-memory data store and cache, which is ideal for applications that require fast access to data. Implementing a write-through caching strategy ensures that data is written to the cache and the primary data store (RDS) simultaneously, keeping the cache up to date. Reading data from the cache can significantly reduce latency and the load on the RDS database, making it an optimal solution for applications with high read demand.",

A rule specifies which events to send to which targets for processing. A single rule can send an event to multiple targets, which then run in parallel. There are two types of rules: rules that match on event data as events are delivered, and rules that run on a defined schedule. In addition, certain AWS services may create and manage rules in your account as well.\n\nAmazon EventBridge rule that match on event data - match against incoming events based on event data criteria,an event pattern. An event pattern defines the event structure and the fields that a rule matches. If an event matches the criteria defined in the event pattern, EventBridge sends it to the target(s) you specify.",

We can define a subset of users i.e. 10% for a set period of time. After this the other users will be impacted as the percentage will increment or the deployment will push new code to 100% of users.\n\nWith a weighted alias we can define a subset of users and use this as our guinea pigs to test new code. As this isn't a canary deployment we have no risk of more users becoming impacted. Operational overhead is minimal as we only need to point to a new alias.\n\nWith weighted alias we can deploy for testing purposes. From my understanding lambda proxy is grouping lambda functions. the traffic splitting would need to be set at the lambda level as this is testing prior to deployment.",

As we already have reports of performance issues here I think the more long winded canary option is less feasible. \nthe canary checks for broken links and compares screenshots to baseline images, it also checks for heart beats and whether API's read/write functionality is working.\nI feel like Xray would be the better tool as the SDK with provide higher quality metrics and highlight latency, bottlenecks or other performance issues at any point in the service map. It is a single tool as opposed to option D's needing two tools and ultimately if option D requires X-ray to add granularity to canary results why not just start with X-ray.",

Create a global secondary index (GSI) with subject_name as the partition key and top_score as the sort key.\n\nHere's why: The goal is to efficiently retrieve the student ID of the top scorer for each subject. A GSI allows querying on a key combination different from the table's primary key. By using subject_name as the partition key, you can easily query all scores for a given subject. Then, sorting by top_score in descending order will allow you to quickly identify the top scorer using a single query. An LSI (options A and B) is tied to the table's primary key, making efficient retrieval of this data impossible. Option D would allow retrieval of student IDs given a subject, but not directly sorted by top score to find the top scorer for each subject efficiently. A GSI offers the flexibility to achieve the desired retrieval speeds without requiring multiple queries.",

The data in the table's partition key column is not evenly distributed.\nExplanation\n\nIn DynamoDB, the provisioned throughput capacity is distributed across all the partitions in the table. If the data in the partition key column is not evenly distributed, some partitions may receive more traffic than others. This can lead to hot partitions, which consume more read/write capacity units than others, resulting in ProvisionedThroughputExceededException errors even if the overall request rate is within the table's provisioned throughput limits.",

Only the first request per second and some additional requests are recorded. This setup is not helping the company review the requests based on service or request type.\nA developer must configure rules to trace requests based on service or request properties.

This ensures that the system resources are conserved for more critical user interactions and transactions.\n\nHigher Sampling Rate for User Interactions: By sampling at a higher rate for requests that handle user interactions or transactions, you can ensure that these important requests are traced more comprehensively. This allows for better monitoring and troubleshooting of the application where it matters most.\n\nSelective Tracing: This approach allows you to selectively trace and monitor requests based on their importance and volume. High-volume background tasks are sampled minimally or not at all, while low-volume but critical user interactions and transactions are sampled more frequently.",

Each bucket's policy should explicitly specify which Lambda function to invoke when an event occurs in that bucket.

Publish a new version: Lambda's versioning mechanism allows you to deploy updated code without affecting the currently running version. This is a crucial first step.\n\nC. Create an alias and configure weighted routing: API Gateway doesn't directly support weighted routing to different Lambda function versions. However, creating an alias allows you to point to multiple versions of a function. You can then configure the API Gateway to use this alias, allowing for weighted routing between the versions through the alias. This provides a controlled rollout of the updated function.",

It is commonly used to implement caching layers in applications because it can provide fast, low-latency access to frequently accessed data. In this case, caching the most viewed products would allow the application to quickly retrieve this data without querying the RDS for MySQL database every time, which would reduce the load on the database and improve performance.\n\nHow it works: The application would update to use the ElastiCache for Redis cluster endpoint to store and retrieve the most viewed products.

Set up AWS User Notifications to provide a notification when Macie detects security issues.\n\nReasoning:\n\n    Amazon Macie is specifically designed to automatically discover, classify, and protect sensitive data stored in Amazon S3 buckets.\n\n    Macie can detect unencrypted data, public access issues, and sensitive data exposure.\n\n    It integrates with Amazon EventBridge and User Notifications to send alerts when security issues are detected.\n\n    Other options like Inspector (C) do not scan S3 for data classification or encryption status (Inspector is more for EC2 and ECR).\n\n    Step Functions + Athena (A) would require custom development and maintenance, which is unnecessary since Macie natively does this.\n\n    Kinesis + Lambda (D) would be overly complex, error-prone, and again unnecessary because Macie exists specifically for this use case.",

This means that as the number of Lambda calls increases, each call also triggers a request from the Parameter Store, which increases the number of requests and leads to exceeding the limit.\n\nUsing an SSM dynamic reference as an environmental variable in CloudFormation will allow Lambda to load the value only once on startup, and there will be no need to request the value of the variable from the Parameter Store on each call. This way, the value is obtained directly from the pre-loaded environmental variable instead of sending additional requests.",

If the question highlights unpredictable traffic, On-Demand Mode (B) is likely the better choice. However, if the traffic peaks are predictable and manual control is desired, increasing shards (D) is the optimal solution.",

You can configure the \"days to expiration\" value when these events are first published for your certificates. ACM automatically attempts to renew an ACM generated certificate 60 days prior to certificate expiration. Hence, these events only show up for certificates that have not yet been, or could not be, renewed. Events are published for both issued and imported certificates.\n\nFor example, when set to 45, the first event will be published when a certificate is 45 days away from its expiration date, followed by one event per day until expiration.",

If you require notifications earlier than 45 days, AWS Config's managed rule allows you to specify a custom number of days for the check.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/APIReference/API_ExpiryEventsConfiguration.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\n\nQuestion is asking for 90 days earlier than expiration, so D is the right answer.",

Increase the Lambda function’s timeout value.\nExplanation:\n\nThe error message \"Task timed out after 3.01 seconds\" clearly indicates that the Lambda function is not being given enough time to complete its task — specifically, moving images larger than 2 MB. This is a timeout configuration issue, not a concurrency issue or a problem with the code logic.\n\n    A is correct because increasing the timeout allows the function more time to complete processing.\n\n    B avoids the problem rather than solving it.\n\n    C (concurrency quota increase) deals with how many instances can run simultaneously, not execution time.\n\n    D (provisioned concurrency) ensures a function is pre-initialized but doesn't fix timeout errors.",

Configure the SQS queue’s visibility timeout value to be greater than the maximum time it takes to call the third-party API.\nExplanation:\n\nWhen a Lambda function reads a message from an SQS queue, the message becomes invisible for the duration of the visibility timeout. If the Lambda function doesn’t finish processing (or doesn’t delete the message from the queue) before the visibility timeout expires, the message becomes visible again and may be reprocessed, causing duplicates.\n\nSince the third-party API can take up to 60 seconds, the visibility timeout should be set to greater than 60 seconds to ensure that the message remains hidden from other consumers until the Lambda function finishes processing it.",

S3 bucket policies control access, not version retention.\n\n    C. S3 Object Lock is used for WORM (Write Once Read Many) compliance and legal holds, not for version count control.\n\n    D.

By enabling X-Ray on your Lambda function, you can trace its calls to external services—in this case, Amazon S3. In the generated trace map, clicking the connection (or line) between the Lambda function and S3 shows you detailed timing information, including the latency for the S3 calls. This makes it possible to pinpoint where delays are occurring.",

        "comment": "B. Revise the primary key to use more unique identifiers.\nExplanation:\n\nThe ProvisionedThroughputExceededException occurs when too many requests are made to a single partition key, which causes hot partitioning in DynamoDB. In this case, since the partition key is \"country\", a spike in players from a single country will overload that partition.\n\nTo resolve this, the developer should revise the primary key to distribute read/write traffic more evenly—for example, by including a more granular identifier like a user ID along with the country (e.g., a composite key or a more randomized key structure).\nWhy not the others:\n\n    A. Strongly consistent reads actually require more throughput, worsening the issue.\n\n    C. Pagination helps with large result sets but doesn't resolve partition throughput limits.\n\n    D. Scan operations are less efficient and consume more throughput than queries.",
